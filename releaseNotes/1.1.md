**What's new in 1.1:**

* Changed "config.xml" to "jmarkpad.properties". (JMarkPad no longer user XML files)
* JMarkPad will now remember the last directory you worked in and open it by default the next time you are searching for your documents.


**Bug fixes:**

* Fixed a bug that caused opening an existing document to automatically mark it as already edited.

**Other changes:**

* Various GUI improvements ("About" section reworked, color sistem rewritten, button appearance improved).
* Updated JFoenix from 8.0.1 to 8.0.4.
* Updated Flexmark from 0.32.4 to 0.34.0.


**NOTES:**

THIS VERSION IS NOT 100% COMPATIBLE WITH PREVIOUS VERSIONS. JMarkPad 1.1 won't be able to load previous configuration files.
